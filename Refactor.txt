Switch MySQL queries to prepared statements, prevent injection (potentially remove sql queries if possible by applying Hibernate on the Account. NOTE THAT THIS WILL REQUIRE REROUTING TO MULTIPLE TABLES)
Change "isacitve" to "is_active", typo in MySQL table
Change naming of tables to better describe its usage, potentially add description to the table and its keys
Generally fix MySQL structure, said changes will happen on a local database to confirm it working

Separate controllers correctly, move mappings not belonging to said controller to its own controller

Make "shared" module that both "app" and "services" can access to prevent duplicate models

Make comments in classes to explain their usage
Rename to proper cases such as camelCase and PascalCase, as seen with "birthdate" in "Account.java"
"NotificationService" package should not be uppercased
Is it "domain" or "models"? Mismatch in "service" and "app", I vote for "models"

Create the proper ranks: "STUDENT", "INSTRUCTOR", "ADMIN"

Make dummy files for the properties, then gitignore it
